            <ul>
                <li>It's always warm during the day yet surprising cool during the evening and night</li>
                <li>Train rides are available along the edge of the canyon</li>
                <li>Overall a pretty nice place</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h4>Hawaii</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Absolutely beautiful</li>
                <li>Lots of attractions to see</li>
                <li><em>Be warned</em>, its <strong>very</strong> expensive to stay there. It's absolutely worth the cost though</li>
                <li>The islanders are extremely festive, especially durring New Year's Eve. They'll lauch off so many fireworks that night becomes day for a few seconds</li>
            </ul>
        <h5>Camp Merriwether</h5>
        <img src="https://pamplinmedia.com/images/artimg/00003542196098.jpg">
        <ul>
            <li>It's right next to the Pacific ocean, close enough to hear the waves on the beach</li>
            <li>Several activities available at the campsite ranging from rock-climbing to archery and even has a blackpowder gun-range</li>
            <li>Used consistently by the BoyScouts organization as a summer camp</li>
